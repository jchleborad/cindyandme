            <span style="font-size: .9rem">(A Quick Get-Away)</span>
            <p class="mt-3">It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. Today, the pictures are worth a thousand memories. Through
                the lens of our cameras we saw new places in our world. We have some striking shots, but they simply do not
                do the radiant scenes justice. The wonder isn’t in the photographs, it is in the memories of the day. The
                photos will always spark a reflection of the moments spent experiencing an adventure together.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was April and we had just a short time together before we left for summer break. We fell immensely in love, survived the
                time away and were married a short time later. We have raised two fantastic children and are now experiencing
                life in huge way. These are the places we visit and the stories we tell. Enjoy!

            <p class="lead mb-0">6’ From the Edge</p>
            <span style="font-size: .9rem">(Horseshoe Bend, March 30th)</span>

            <p class="mt-3">As we came up to the parking lot all I could think was, “I know I read they have restrooms!” It has been a long
                haul from Flagstaff, and we were desperate. I think it was after we returned to the car we realized we were
                at Horseshoe Bend, one of the must-do’s in Page, Arizona. It was also one of the first moments we realized
                not everything is how it seems.</p>

            <p>You see, in order to get to the cliffs to see the river you must hike a little over half a mile. The trail is
                all downhill, and sandy. I mean the finest sand you have seen. Here we were in the middle of the high desert
                walking as though we were on a beach. It is slow going.</p>

            <p>John has a theory about canyons, if he stays six feet from the edge he is safe. Of course this can really hamper
                your view if the sight is almost straight down. So eventually he got up enough nerve to stand about 5’6”
                from the edge. Just enough for his eyes to see below, and it was worth it!</p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote text-center">
                <footer style="padding-top:0px; font-size: 1rem">This is such an amazing place!
                    <cite class="blockquote-footer" title="Source Title">John upon seeing the view</cite>
                </footer>
            </blockquote>

            <p>As I stood 2’-3’ feet from the edge, all I could think is that water will always choose the path of least resistance.
                How could bending like a horseshoe ever be easy path? This make no logical sense to me. But then you see
                it and you understand that the sense is not in the path of the river, but in what is being taught to us.
                The beauty is in the journey, not in the shortest route.</p>

            <p>I am excited for the rest of our weekend travels</P>

            <p class="lead mb-3">Antelope Canyon</p>
            <span style="font-size: .9rem">Morning Butterflies</span>
            <p>This morning I woke up with butterflies in my stomach because by lunch time I will be crossing an item off my
                bucket list. I remember this feeling when I was a little girl specifically waking up at Laura’s house heading
                to Universal Studios to celebrate her birthday, dance competitions in San Gabriel, and leaving for vacation.
                As an adult I still get this same feeling on days when I will be blessed with a once in a life time experience
                such as our wedding day, starting a sought-after job, leaving to share an experience with our children, and
                moving the children into their first home away from home.</p>

            <p>As part of my birthday John arranged for us to take a tour of Antelope Canyon! The canyon is one of God’s miracle
                creations. The scenes are touted as breath-taking. In fact, I may be able to cross two things off my bucket
                list...taking that “one” picture.
            </p>
            <span style="font-size: .9rem">Evening Impressions</span>
            <p>Antelope Canyon was more miraculous than I could have imagined! I have seen pictures and more pictures of this
                hidden slot canyon. I thought I would be impressed, but instead it was a feeling of total awe that can only
                be brought on by unique beauty that blesses you beyond what you feel you deserve. </P>
            <p>What did I expect? Well, I expected a few spots to take a few pictures that are over printed and for sale in
                tourist traps throughout Arizona. On the contrary the experience was one that yielded over 100 captures,
                and a feeling that 100’s more were unseen. With every twist and turn I found my self trying to look up, look
                down and circle in a 360 in effort not to miss anything, and I know going back would be a fresh experience.
            </p>
            <p>Maybe someday…</p>

                        <span style="font-size: .9rem">The Perfect (Kokopelli) Pot</span>
                        <p class="mt-3">If Highway 89A is considered one of the paths least traveled in Arizona, they clearly were not on
                            our path today. The journey began about 3:30 yesterday and ended in a moment of grit determination.
                        </p>

                        <p>Yesterday at roadside stop John decided that he would like a Navajo Pot to put in his new office.
                            He has been looking decor, and I thought it was a great idea. This was so much better than anything
                            that could be picked up at Hobby Lobby. This would have some meaning for him. Who knows, maybe
                            seeing the pot daily will inspire the planning of our next adventure. Needless to say, I was
                            all for it, that is until I realized it had to be the perfect pot.
                        </p>
                        <p>This morning we hopped on the highway headed back home with the plan to stop at some roadside vendors
                            hoping to find the perfect pot. Let’s just say if the government thought we were interesting
                            enough to track even they would have been confused.
                        </P>
